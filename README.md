# borromean-ts

## DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
This is a weekend project made within the span of a day (really a couple hours). I haven't done any checks to see if it's correct and there is a high chance of a bug lying around somewhere. Hopefully I'll revisit when I have more time.

## What is this?
This is a typescript reference implementation for borromean ring signatures (detailed [here](https://nt4tn.net/papers/borromean_draft_0.01_34241bb.pdf)).

## TODO
- [ ] Implement verification
